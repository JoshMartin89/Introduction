# Introduction
A little bit about myself and my programming background

Hello! I have a bachelors degree from Oakland University in Biological sciences
were after graduating I ended up finding a job as a technical recruiter. During the pandemic I decided to go back to school for programming.
I graduated from OCC with an associates degree in software engineering. While I was taking my classes I learned Kotlin, Java, and C++ and worked on
a variety of projects including an android application, the creation of an SQL database, and many others.

I am currently looking for an entry level or internship opportunity and am eager to learn more about software and its applications.
Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little bit better!
